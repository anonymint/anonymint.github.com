<p>Wright Brothers</p>

<p>Start with a big problem: “We need to get into the sky. How do we do it?” </p>

<p>Break it into smaller, knowable unknowns: “They knew they didn’t know the drag coefficient or the optimal wing design, and they set out to solve both.” </p>

<p>Grind and innovate: “They taught themselves engineering principles, and designed prototypes of flexible wings to test. They knew they needed to tactically implement a solution to test quickly, so they built a wind tunnel. Suddenly they could test over 200 wing designs, and finally they arrived at a better wing that worked. It wasn’t a breakthrough, it was the grind.”</p>
