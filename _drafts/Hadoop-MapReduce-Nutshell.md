<p>What's Hadoop?</p>

<p>It's platform providing both distributed computational abilities(aka MapRedue) and storage(aka Hadoop Distributed File System HDFS). It was first introduced in the scalability issue in an open source crawler and search engine Apache Nutch which was at the same time Google had published papers explaining Google File System(GFS) and Map-Reduce. Later on the concepts had split into 2 projects, the second one became Apache Hadoop.</p>

<p>MapRedude</p>

<p>The MapReduce model makes parallel processing by abstracting away the complexities regarding doing some works with distributed systems, such as computational parallelization, work distribution, and dealing with unstable hardware and software so as to give programmers a focus mind in only business logic.</p>
