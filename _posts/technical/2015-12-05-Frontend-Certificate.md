title: Finally I am frontend certified
---

First of all, I consider myself backend kind of person until recently I thought that would be awesome to be fullstack engineer capable. This will give me lot of options and new perspective of development.

I decided to join the band of wagon via [FreeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/) in June this year but for some work schedule and personal excuse I managed to take FrontEnd Certificate!
