title: The Curse of Monad

<p>As part of my personal interest in Functional Programming aka. FP and as part of my journey the more I get into cult(ture) of FP, the more I have heard many people kept talking about Monad and sometimes Manoid. So what is Monad?</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote-reverse">
  <p>Once you understand monads, you immediately become incapable of explaining them to anyone else</p>

<p>First of all, I would say I don't get it 100% I feel like I know some concepts but not like shining in my head.</p>

<p>Therefore I will not try to convey you my understanding of Monad but instead pointing out to some Blogs, articles or white paper that might trigger your understanding.</p>

<p>Why do I do this? It's curse!!!</p>

<p>Let start from this casual video by Dr. Brian Beckman, a Channel 9 celebrity, astrophysicist and senior software engineer. He thought it would be a very good idea to address the complexity of monads in an easy to understand way: a technical conversation at the white board with yours truly for Channel 9. It's for msdn 9 channel so we would hear c#, f# and a bit of Linq yes Erik Meijer the creator of LINQ and yes it's Monad.</p>

<p>Further more if you're familiar with Scala, this video on <a target="_blank" href="https://class.coursera.org/reactive-001/lecture/27/">Coursera Reactive Programming</a> explained from Scala perspective</p>

<p>
Now you might be in a good state of Monad perception already. You can start reading article to explain why do we care about Monad and because that's mainly to control the complexity by composition. In addition we will see some of the explanation of List Monad, Continuation Monad.

From the above article, the author point out to the source of Idea rising from a white paper "The Essence of Functional Programming" published by Philip Wadler from Universyti of Glasfow in short the paper mentions the GRASP team at Glasgow building a complier for Haskel written in Haskell and uses Monads as principle.</p>

<p>If you make this far and still have lot of questions in your mind like me, keep reading and even get a hand on real example world.
One day we might compose something out of something this idea that change the world!!
