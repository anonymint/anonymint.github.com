I have been in SRE Conference or SREcon America 2018 for the first time here my briefly touch on this.

SRE is equally capable and think-a-like as the software engineer.

Google SRE developed sophisticated distributed tracing tool using internally 1000+ metrics across multiple regions

Uber uses machine learning to predict capacities of resources by creating the model of a number of trips correlating to CPU usage of servers then predicting using linear regression model.

JET developed internal tracing distributed system (open source soon) to use with event sourcing applications to pin down the root cause by injecting service name, unique id carrying along the way per transaction then store this information for query purpose.

Shopify developed onboarding application for Dev team to get the application running on K8 with less friction by providing UI app for Dev team to choose what types and then create all needed config, the pipeline for an app to start with.

Pinterest eng created and maintained docker orchestration platform for the team even help migrate running on VM to Messo and later on move to K8 while developing a tool to debug, fix and remediate any container related issue to ease developers to move quickly.

Facebook SRE (called Production engineer for FB) developed plugin on top of MySQL to help developer team to migrate from MySQL to RockDB which using fewer resources than normal DB and match use case of Facebook also at the same time providing a patch to MySQL for the community.

Microsoft Azure SRE purposed idea of scaling postmortem process, data to another level by what if we have a lot of clean data + machine learning we can co-related and predict the domain problem which most likely to happen based on given data, parameters (posterior naive bales theory)
