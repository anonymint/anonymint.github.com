Every Java developers must have an experience to create ones own utility class in static class, static method, factory pattern so on so forth when it comes to the time we share work among many developers it will end up almost the same function with different perspective. removeLineFeed(), removeWeirdCharacters(), deleteNumeric() are all share the same features we need to remove something from the string sigh.

That's story end up in a big guys over there in the Google team as well that's called "Guava"

The Guava project contains several of Google's core libraries that we rely on in our Java-based projects: collections, caching, primitives support, concurrency libraries, common annotations, string processing, I/O, and so forth.

Here is a good presentation from Kevin Bourrillion at QCon San Francisco 2012 <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Guava">presentation</a>
