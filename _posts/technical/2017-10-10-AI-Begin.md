 For a while, I'm very interested in Machine Learning and like everyone else I know, they will mention about Andrew Ng [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) and I did take it and I found it is very good. Currently he found a new course on Deep Learning as well, if you're interested in.

However I need more than that so I keep searching and found a mother of all book taught in top University [Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach](https://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Intelligence-Modern-Approach-3rd/dp/0136042597) The book is very deep and lot of details in, that what I found out Peter Norvig is part of [Udacity AI Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/ai), and 6 months later.

After 10-20 hours per week, 6 projects, a very thick book read and brush up Math (Linear algebra, Probability and etc) I finish the course 1 month before the time!
