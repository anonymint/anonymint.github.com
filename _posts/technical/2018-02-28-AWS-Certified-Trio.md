I have been long since last IT certification I got almost 9 years ago SCJP JavaSE 5 which was long before Oracle bought Sun Microsystem and renamed it to OCP.

Since July 2017 at Chicago Summit, I decided to start taking my AWS knowledge to another level after years of personal usage and my company started Cloud migration initiative.

First I took AWS Solution architect Associate in July 2017, I gained more and more knowledge before deciding in 3 days preparation to take another AWS Developer Associate at AWS Re-Invent 2017 in Las Vegas. 

Why only (or over) 3 days, well the fundamental is the same I know the network and security part of AWS and with hand-on and work experiences which I couldn't emphasize more, the solution will pop up in your head even before finish reading the problem statement. 

A couple of months later on, I got the last associate certificate exam, the AWS SysOps Administrator. 

Now the trick to re-certify the 2 years expired time of this exam is to take the AWS Professional level to refresh lower certification automatically which is in my plan.

Let see the next one is coming real soon!
