<p>I have been thinking to join the QCon San Francisco for while and my mission just completed at year 2013. The overall atmosphere was awesome and reminded me when I was freshmen at Uni. It's 5 days packed with mind blowing talking in many topics ranging from improving one piece of API to new trend shaping for the future.</p>

<p>I would suggest any IT people to join this event just once with self-passion to learn, listen, discuss from your deepest mind. These talks are published on Infoq.com all the time not just QCon but all kind of IT Conference. If you love watching it before bed, while having dinner or switching away from Channel 9 blockbuster movie to recording Conference. You're good to go :)</p>
