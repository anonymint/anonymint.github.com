Today is my first day of the second term of Self-Driving car class. Mostly this term will focus on the mechanic of the system, [Sensor Fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor_fusion), Localization, and Control.

To get lower latency and best performance out of the system, I'll start doing C++ as part of this term which I know just enough to solve algorithms problem so that's quite exciting to me.

As part of this term, I'll blog all journey along the way what I have learned and summarize that out.
