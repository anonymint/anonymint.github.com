<p>I have something to introduce to anyone who want to know that your productivity is good, bad, neutral. Last year I enrolled in one of the Mathematics course on Coursera and the lecture introduced a cool way to track your time daily passively and easily.  </p>

<p>It's RescueTime running on any OS and track your activities every active time while you're on your machine.</p>

<p>Here is example of my report on Tuesday 7</p>

<p>So you can see i am working for 7h 48m on Tuesday excluding idle time like lunch time. I started my work around 9am and left around 6pm. 88 percent of my time was productivity based on the tools, website i was working on.</p>

<p>Rescue has their own database to determine which tools, sites are productive but you can add ones for your own under "Uncategorised" section like I made any websites like wiki, certain blogs to productive list of sites.</p>

<strong>There are also some details of each section</strong>

<ul>
	<li>65% of my time was on Software Development category eg putty, javaw, idea, sublime, github and stackoverflow </li>
	<li>15% of my time was on Communication &amp; Scheduling eg. skype, outlook, communicator(lync) </li>
	<li>11% of my time was on Reference &amp; Learning eg. yourkit.com, wiki, blogs and etc</li>
	<li>2% of my time was distracted by other websites - I know it was at lunch time and around 2-3pm :) i know where i have to improve.</li>
</ul>

 
<p>All in all this tool will help me by sending me a daily report of my last working day. If my productivity drops I will start looking on the area i spend the most and cut that down. So that's idea. </p>
