<p class="lead">
Hi! my name is <strong>Mint</strong> but you may know me as <strong>Ekalak</strong>, that's fine. I use my legal name in many places but eventually when they know my short or nick name it sticks!

One thing I'm certain with technology. 
<ul class="lead">
    <li>Keep learning do not settle whatever you learn today it will be outdated soon.</li>
    <li>You can not improve something you can not measure.</li>
    <li>If you hear something in your head "it does not make sense", it will and finally does not make sense in the end.</li>
</ul>
