<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
Hi! my name Ekalak but everyone called me 'Mint'. I'm so curious of all kind of technology. I have to admit I wasn't a Com-Science or Com-Eng lads who spend 4 years in University. I have graduated in Electical Engineer which minimal exposed to computer as all we know.

My Journey just started when I was young. I got a short-term-scholar visting New Zealand which i have to pay only $1000 to stay aboard for a month!!! My mom asked me "here is a deal" you can choose to go there or you want a PC? well 486 intel with 256M and CD-ROM!!! I chose the later and i destroyed the whole OS (Windows 95 at that time) at the first day.

Fast Forward like Git, after finishin my 4 years I didn't interest in Electrical at all so I started working as IT people.
</p>

<p>	
I have been enjoying my life ever since.
