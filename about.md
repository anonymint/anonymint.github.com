<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
Hey my name is <strong>Ekalak</strong> but you can call me <strong>Mint</strong> and you should.
</p> 

<p>
I'm so curious of all kind of technology. I have to admit I wasn't a Com-Science or Com-Eng lads who spend 4 years in University. I have graduated in Electical Engineer which minimal exposed to computer as all we know.
</p>

<p>
My Journey just started when I was young. I got a short-term-scholar visting New Zealand which i have to pay only $1000 to stay aboard for a month!!! My mom asked me "here is a deal" you can choose to go there or you want a PC? well 486 intel with 256M and CD-ROM!!! I chose the later and i destroyed the whole OS (Windows 3.11 at that time) at the first day. 
</p>

<p>
Fast Forward like Git, after finishin my 4 years I didn't interest in Electrical at all so I started working as IT people.
</p>

<p>
One thing i'm certain with technology. 
<ul>
	<li>Keep learning don't be subtle Whatever you learn today it will be outdated soon</li>
	<li>You can't improve something you can't measure it</li>
	<li>If you hear something in your head "it doesn't make sense", it will and always doesn't make sense in the end</li>
</ul>
