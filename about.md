<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
Hi! my name is <strong>Ekalak</strong> but you can call me <strong>Mint</strong> in short.
</p> 

<p>
I'm so curious of all kind of technology. I have to admit I wasn't a Com-Science or Com-Eng lads who spent 4 years in the University. I have graduated in Electrical Engineer which was minimal exposed to computer as all we know.
</p>

<p>
My Journey just started when I was young. I got a short-term-scholar visiting New Zealand which i have to pay only $1000 fee to exchange and stay aboard for a month!!! My mom asked me "Kid here is mom's offer" you can choose to go there or you want a PC? well 486 Intel with 256M of RAM and built-in CD-ROM!!! I chose the latter and i wiped out the whole OS (Windows 3.11 at that time) at the first day. The guys who sold PC to me came to my house almost everyday to reinstall OS because I was curious to run every commands especially <code>del *.*</code> 
</p>

<p>
Fast Forward like Git, after finishing my 4 years I didn't interest in Electrical at all so I started working as IT people.
</p>

<p>
One thing I'm certain with technology. 
<ul>
	<li>Keep learning don't be subtle Whatever you learn today it will be outdated soon</li>
	<li>You can't improve something you can't measure it</li>
	<li>If you hear something in your head "it doesn't make sense", it will and always doesn't make sense in the end</li>
</ul>
